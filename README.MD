Stripped down version from....

.... Thanks for sharing :-)

Serves simple page from ESP32 and then makes socket connection to send and receive variables in the background. Ideal template for fast development of IOT devices. Added JSON objects to easily send / receive variables and IO between ESP32 and browser.

Requires latest MicroPython firmware on ESP32, programmed and uploaded with 'Thonny'
